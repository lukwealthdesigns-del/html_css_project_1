# Health Awareness Campaign Website

## Case Study: “Say No to Drug Abuse”

### 📖 Scenario  
A youth NGO called Hope for the Future** is worried about the rise of drug abuse among teenagers. They want to launch a “Say No to Drugs” awareness campaign to educate young people and inspire them to make better life choices.  

Since they cannot afford a big social media campaign, they decided to start with a **simple but powerful website** that communicates their message clearly.  

They’ve reached out to your team to design and build this awareness website using only HTML + CSS.

### 🎯 Goals of the Project  
The NGO’s website should:  
1. Educate visitors about the dangers of drug abuse.  
2. Inspire young people by giving them positive alternatives**.  
3. Engage them with real quotes or testimonies.  
4. Invite visitors to take action (contact/join the movement).

### 📌 Your Tasks
Your group must build a single-page website that includes the following sections:  

1. Header Section  
   - Campaign title (e.g., *“Say No to Drugs”*).  
   - A bold slogan (e.g., *“Your Future is Greater than Drugs”*).  

2. Awareness Section  
   - A short paragraph describing the dangers of drug abuse (at least 4–5 points).  
   - You can use a list or paragraph format.  

3. Healthy Alternatives Section**  
   - A list of at least 5 positive activities** young people can do instead of drugs.  
   - Example: sports, coding, music, reading, volunteering.  
   - Use CSS to style this list differently so it stands out.  

4. Testimonial/Quote Section 
   - A quote or testimony box styled with a different background color or border.  
   - Example: “I chose football instead of drugs, and it changed my life.”  

5. Join Us Section  
   - Contact info for the NGO (email, phone, social media links).  
   - A call-to-action like: “Join us in building a drug-free future!”.
